# Backend Implementation Plan for MERN Job Board Project

## Task 1: Project Planning and Design

### Project Idea
- Job board platform for job seekers and employers
- Features: job listings, company profiles, user authentication, job applications, real-time notifications

### Database Schema Design
- User
  - _id, name, email, passwordHash, role (jobseeker, employer, admin), createdAt, updatedAt
- Company
  - _id, name, description, website, location, createdAt, updatedAt
- Job
  - _id, title, description, companyId (ref Company), location, salaryRange, skillsRequired, status (open/closed), postedAt, updatedAt
- Application
  - _id, jobId (ref Job), userId (ref User), resumeUrl, coverLetter, status (applied, reviewed, accepted, rejected), appliedAt, updatedAt

### API Endpoints
- Auth
  - POST /api/auth/signup
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - GET /api/auth/profile
- Users
  - GET /api/users/:id
  - PUT /api/users/:id
- Companies
  - GET /api/companies
  - POST /api/companies
  - GET /api/companies/:id
  - PUT /api/companies/:id
- Jobs
  - GET /api/jobs
  - POST /api/jobs
  - GET /api/jobs/:id
  - PUT /api/jobs/:id
  - DELETE /api/jobs/:id
- Applications
  - POST /api/jobs/:id/apply
  - GET /api/users/:id/applications
  - PUT /api/applications/:id/status

### Roadmap and Milestones
- Week 1: Setup backend project, MongoDB connection, user authentication
- Week 2: Implement company and job CRUD APIs
- Week 3: Implement job application APIs and real-time notifications
- Week 4: Testing, deployment, and documentation

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- Use Express.js for REST API
- Use Mongoose for MongoDB ODM
- Use JWT for authentication
- Use Socket.io for real-time features
- Use Jest and Supertest for testing

---

## Task 2: Backend Development

- Setup Express.js server with middleware (CORS, body-parser, logging)
- Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose
- Define Mongoose schemas and models for User, Company, Job, Application
- Implement authentication with JWT (signup, login, protected routes)
- Implement API routes and controllers for all entities
- Add middleware for logging, validation, error handling, and security (helmet, rate limiting)
- Integrate Socket.io for real-time job posting notifications
- Write unit and integration tests for API endpoints

---

## Task 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for models and utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints using Supertest
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows (optional)
- Perform manual testing with Postman or similar tools
- Conduct code reviews and refactor as needed
- Ensure code meets security and accessibility standards

---

## Task 5: Deployment and Documentation

- Deploy backend to a cloud provider (Heroku, Vercel, or similar)
- Setup CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment (GitHub Actions)
- Configure monitoring and error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Create comprehensive documentation:
  - README with setup and usage instructions
  - API documentation (Swagger or Postman collection)
  - User guide for API consumers
  - Technical architecture overview
- Prepare presentation slides showcasing the project

---

This plan covers all backend tasks 1-5 as per the Week 8 assignment requirements.
