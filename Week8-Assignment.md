# üèÜ Week 8: Capstone Project and Presentation ‚Äì Bringing Your MERN Skills Together

## üöÄ Objective
Design, develop, and deploy a comprehensive full-stack MERN application that showcases all the skills you've learned throughout the course, including database design, RESTful API development, real-time features, testing, and deployment.

## üìÇ Tasks

### Task 1: Project Planning and Design
- Choose a project idea that solves a real-world problem
- Create wireframes and mockups for your application
- Design the database schema and relationships
- Plan the API endpoints and data flow
- Create a project roadmap with milestones
- Document your technical architecture decisions

### Task 2: Backend Development
- Set up a MongoDB database with appropriate schemas and validation
- Develop a RESTful API using Express.js with proper error handling
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Create middleware for logging, validation, and security
- Add real-time functionality with Socket.io where appropriate
- Write comprehensive tests for your API endpoints

### Task 3: Frontend Development
- Build a responsive UI using React and modern CSS techniques
- Implement client-side routing with React Router
- Create reusable components with proper state management
- Connect to the backend API and handle data fetching
- Add form validation and error handling
- Implement real-time updates on the client side

### Task 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for critical components and functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Perform manual testing across different devices and browsers
- Conduct code reviews and refactoring as needed
- Ensure the application meets accessibility standards

### Task 5: Deployment and Documentation
- Deploy your application to production (backend and frontend)
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Configure monitoring and error tracking
- Create comprehensive documentation for your project:
  - README with setup instructions
  - API documentation
  - User guide
  - Technical architecture overview
- Prepare a presentation showcasing your application

## üß™ Expected Outcome
- A fully functional, deployed MERN stack application
- Source code in a GitHub repository with proper documentation
- Comprehensive test suite with good coverage
- Live demonstration of the application
- Project presentation highlighting key features and technical decisions

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Ideas (Optional)
